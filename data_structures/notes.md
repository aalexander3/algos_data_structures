# how to computers store data?
 - RAM (random access memory)
 - storage (music, video, images) permanent & persistent (slow storage)
 - CPU needs access to ram and storage

Programs get saved into storage and get persisted
## RAM is a massive storage area
 - has a ton of information
 - little shelves of bits
 - shelves have address lookup
 - CPU is connected to memory controller
 - CPU cache with memory of recent lookups

### data structures store information
 - INT get stored in 32 bits
 - 8 bit systems can store 255 blocks of information
 - in javascript you cannot store numbers above a certain threshold
 - data types all have a number of allocated storage
 - arrangement of data

### data structures in different languages
 - JS:
 - arrays and objects


## operations on data structures
 - insertion
 - deletion
 - traversal
 - search
 - sort
 - access
