## Sorting
---
why is sorting important?
 - large inputs
 - small inputs don't matter too much
 - more expensive
 - sorting data means it is more meaningful
 - better results for a consumer
 - sorting and searching are huge CS problems in software!

---
## why not use built in .sort()??
---
 - built in sort methods might have particular implementations and may not work in the desired way
 - browsers have different JavaScript engines and might be implementing different ways of sorting
 - which means:
  - results are not always the same
  - time complexity can vary

## some algorithms being used
---
 - Radix Sort
 - Quick Sort
 - Heap Sort
 - Bubble Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Merge Sort
 - Counting Sort

# elementary sorts
 - simple, basic sorting algorithms that are widely known
---

## Bubble Sort
---
how does bubble sort work?
 - bubble up the largest number with multiple pass throughs
 - looping over the list multiple times
 - not the most efficient
 - simple algorithm
 - comparing items in nested loops
 - time complexity O(n^2)
 - space complexity O(1)

## Selection Sort
---
how does selection sort work?
 - scans list of items for the smallest element
 - swaps the found item for the first position
 - multiple pass throughs and comparisons
 - time complexity O(n^2)
 - space complexity O(1)

## Insertion Sort

how does insertion sort work?
