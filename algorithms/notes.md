# Algorithms
---
What are algorithms??
 - allow us to create different processes using data structures
 - perform actions on data
 - tons of algorithms that exist
 - steps in a process to perform an action with computers

Data Structures + Algorithms create programs

# Algorithms List
---
 - sorting
 - dynamic programming
 - BFS & DFS (Searching)
 - Recursion

Algorithms can simplify complexity for big O
large companies handle lots of inputs and data
