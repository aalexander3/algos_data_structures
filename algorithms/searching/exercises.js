//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
 // BFS - don't have to go too far down

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
 // BFS - DFS will take too long ( traversing all the down, over and over again)

//If the tree is very wide:
 // DFS - BFS will need too much memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
 // DFS - find the answer quicker

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
 // DFS - that's what its here for!

//Finding the shortest path:
 // BFS
